You'll need QT 4.2 or greater, libusrp, and libfftw3 to compile and run.  Type "qmake" to generate a Makefile, then "make" to generate the program.  This should create an Oscilloscope executable which you can then run after attaching your USRP.

On some Linux systems, it may be necessary to use the "qmake-qt4" command instead of the "qmake" command.
